List
Starting with lists
we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.
We call these multi-valued variables "collections" or "data structures".

Dic
The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.
Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs. Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory "database" in a single Python variable.

Tuple
Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.
Tuples are a simple version of lists. We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.
